# TODO:
#   1. Analyse the correlation between the numpy and png image. Find some information about methods to get more info
#   from computer tomography: contrasts, T1, T2 etc..
#   2. Write a method to read a dicom to numpy and locate it into dicom class, we need only a few infomation from
#   whole dicom file. We must develop what features are required.
#   3. Make a research about this data. What is located, how can be diagnosed, how people diagnose it right now,
#   what is the key feature of this kind of data. How to detect that something is wrong there.
